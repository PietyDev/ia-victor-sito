Hi, my name is Leyanet, I am a student of the eleventh group of eleventh grade, today I am going to present my English project where I'm going to talk about my future plans. Which is really hard for me since I'm not one of those people who seem to have everything under control. So I am not going to talk about where I will be next weekend, or what plans I have for the holidays, or what I will study when I finish high school, because it is not about where I will go. It is about answering a question related to my true plan for my future. To be the best person I can be and for this I have taken the best of people around me, because the truth is that I want to have the same strength of my mother, the same intellect of my father, the same sense of duty of my sister, the same ingenious of my friend Viviana and even the same vitality of my pet. Because all these combined qualities that I want to have represent my own plan for the future.
